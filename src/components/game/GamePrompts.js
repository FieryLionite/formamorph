Return stat changes as key: value pairs, one per line. Values must be numbers between -20 and 20.
If a stat's upper limit is changed, add a MAX at the end. Example would be increasing max health of player.
Note that stat changes are optional, only update stats that actually change basd on the game events.
Example:
Health: 50 MAX
Hunger: -10`;
